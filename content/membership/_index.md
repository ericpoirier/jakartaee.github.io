    <p>“Through the years, Fujitsu Limited has been not only a user of the Java language, but has also been actively involved in the development of Java, and as a Charter Member of the Java Community Process Executive Committee, it has helped create the development process for the Java language. As the future of Java EE development moves to Eclipse and becomes an Open Source Developed Specification, Fujitsu has joined Eclipse as a Strategic Member in order to continue its participation in the evolution of Java EE as Jakarta EE, providing it in the cloud-native world.”</p>

  <p>“IBM helped create Java EE and guide it through it its teenage years and I’m delighted to have helped it now move to its new home at the Eclipse Foundation and new future as Jakarta EE. I look forward to Jakarta EE quickly adopting cloud native technologies from EE-centric communities like Eclipse MicroProfile and becoming the fast-moving platform we all need for Java in the cloud.“</p>

  <p>“Jakarta EE is a so-long awaited next step in the evolution of Enterprise Java standards. The move of these open standards to the Eclipse Foundation is a welcoming moment for Microsoft to engage with this community more broadly and deeply. For Microsoft, joining the working group is an opportunity to learn from and contribute to the Java open source community and ecosystem.”</p>
